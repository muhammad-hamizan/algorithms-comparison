# Algorithm Complexity Comparison for Save Gotham Problem

## Description
This project compares the efficiency and performance of two algorithms with different time complexities in solving the "Save Gotham" problem from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/save-gotham1222/1). The problem involves finding a solution to an array-based problem in which we compare elements in a specific way to save Gotham city.

The project demonstrates the performance impact of choosing algorithms with different computational complexities and aims to provide insights into when to use each algorithm based on input sizes and constraints. Two solutions are implemented: one with a higher complexity and one with an optimized approach.

## Installation
To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/muhammad-hamizan/algorithms-comparison.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Use the following command to install any required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the project**:
    You can run the algorithm comparison by executing the following command:
    ```bash
    python algorithms_comparison.py
    ```

4. **Files Included**:
   - `algorithms_comparison.py`: Contains the two algorithms to solve the problem.
   - `random_array.py`: Generates random arrays for testing.
   - `sum_of_array.py`: Contains helper functions for sum operations.

## Usage
The project compares the performance of the two algorithms on various array sizes. You can generate random arrays of different sizes and run the algorithms to observe their runtime. The expected output includes a comparison of time taken by both algorithms.

```python
# Example usage
python algorithms_comparison.py
# Output will display time taken by both algorithms for different input sizes
```
